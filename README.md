# Machine-Learning-Projects
While looking for a graduation internship, recreuiters kept asking me for my github profile. But unfortunately, 
all my projects were on my computer. So I decided to improve all of my projects, reorganize them and adding them 
to this folder.

### 01- Full classification pipeline - Titanic Dataset
In this project, I worked on the famous Titanic disaster data set to predict if a passanger will survive or not. This solution gives 78% accuracy using Random forest
and gradient boosting. It has a full pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering,modeling and paramaters tunning. I didn't focus on EDA because my main goal was 
to focus on feature engineering and classification task.You can download the data set from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Please *upvote* 
[my solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/233205) on kaggle if you like it.
